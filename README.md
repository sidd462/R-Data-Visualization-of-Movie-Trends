## Introduction

The Movie Data Analysis and Visualization project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of movies by leveraging R's powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities. The project demonstrates how to utilize R to manipulate, clean, analyze, and visualize movie data, enabling data enthusiasts, movie lovers, and analysts to gain valuable insights into movie attributes and trends.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is obtained from reliable and publicly available sources, such as movie databases, open data repositories, and industry datasets. The dataset includes comprehensive information about movies, such as title, genre, release year, budget, and ratings.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **data**: Contains the raw datasets used in the analysis. These datasets are in CSV format and can be directly accessed for further analysis.
- **scripts**: Includes R scripts that perform data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization tasks. Each script focuses on specific aspects of the analysis, such as genre analysis, budget trends, or rating distributions.
- **visualizations**: Stores the output visualizations generated by the R scripts. These visualizations showcase various types of plots, charts, and graphs that effectively represent the analyzed data.

## Installation

To use this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/sidd462/R-Data-Visualization-of-Movie-Trends


2. Ensure that R and RStudio are installed on your system. If not, download and install them from their official websites.

3. Open RStudio and set the project directory to the cloned repository.

## Usage

The analysis scripts provide step-by-step instructions on how to analyze and visualize the movie data. Each script focuses on specific aspects of the analysis, such as genre analysis, budget trends, or rating distributions.

To run the scripts, open them in RStudio and execute the code cells or sections. The scripts are well-commented, providing explanations for each step and variable.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different analysis techniques, and create your own visualizations to enhance the project further.
